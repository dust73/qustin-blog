# Hello, minty world

This little corner of the internet is powered by pastel greens and low-stress vibes.

No frameworks here—just vanilla HTML, CSS, and a sprinkling of Three.js for the background toys.

## What to expect

- Short notes about UI and tiny tools
- Occasional experiments with WebGL
- A relentless pursuit of delightful details

Thanks for stopping by! 🌿
