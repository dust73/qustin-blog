# Making blobs behave

The secret to pleasant motion is restraint. Autorotate at a whisper. Ease into everything.

## Notes

- Keep rotation speeds uneven so shapes drift past each other
- Use soft lights and avoid harsh specular
- Let the background do less so the content can do more

Tiny choices add up to calm. 🫧
